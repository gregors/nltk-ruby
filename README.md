Clearly there is nothing here just yet. I just wanted to establish the ecosystem for this project before working on it too much.

I don't expect a huge demand as there seemed to not be too much discussion about such a project upon my Googling. I hope to be able to work on this steadily but I'm mostly doing it to learn more about Python, Ruby, and natural language processing.
